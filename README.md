This is the source code of my personal Persian [website](http://sibiya.ir). Persian aka Farsi is written right-to-left, however some people use Roman script to write Persian language in messaging applications and social networks.

This repository can be of use to anybody willing to build a new right to left website. I gradually fix issues which I came across while writing new posts in my website. This website is produced using [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) flat file cms.
